a beautiful and happy girl.
with step as light as summer air.
eyes glad with smiles, and brow of pearl.
shadowed by many a careless curl.
of unconfined and flowing hair.
a seeming child in everything.
save thoughtful brow and ripening charms.
as nature wears the smile of spring.
when sinking into summer's arms.
a mind rejoicing in the light.
which melted through its graceful bower.
leaf after leaf, dew-moist and bright.
and stainless in its holy white.
unfolding like a morning flower.
a heart, which, like a fine-toned lute.
with every breath of feeling woke.
and, even when the tongue was mute.
