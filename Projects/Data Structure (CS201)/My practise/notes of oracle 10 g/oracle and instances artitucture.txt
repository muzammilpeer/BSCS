instance:
is the collection of background process and memory strtucture using type in database;
database:
is the collection of files that contain your data.
oracle database file extension:".dbf" binary file
RAC(real application clusters)
commands:
=========
show parameter db_name or show parameter instance_name: to show database name 
shwo parameter db_block_size : to block size of our oracle.(oracle have any data in form of block)

in linux or unix: 
ps -ef|grep oracle : to show all related file of oracle that are in process.

sqlplus:
========
DATA FILES(*.dbf):
-----------
select file_name, bytes/1024/1024 "MB"
from dba_data_files
order by 1; : to show files name with their size of data base.

select name,creation_time
from v$datafile; : to show file name with data of creation.

LOG FILES(*.log):
----------
select member, status, group# from v#logfile; : to log file with their status and group number
select group#, sequence#, bytes, archived, status from v$log; : to show all the mention things in command.
alter database add logfile member 'c:\oracle\product\10.2.0\oradata\orcl\redo01b.log' to group 1; : alternate file added to group 1.but its status is invalid in next step we will valid it.
alter system switch logfile; : it will redirect the redo log file to alter redo file of above step when first redo file get filled.this statement is run for each new addred redo file separtely.
alter database {if group name then write here} add logfile ('c:\oracle\product\10.2.0\oradata\orcl\redo04.log','c:\oracle\product\10.2.0\oradata\orcl\redo04b.log') size 50m; : to add complete new redo log file with specific group or to new added group.
alter database drop logfile group 4; : to drop the group redolog file.

Undo(*.dbf):
------------

spfile(server process file or init file):
-----------------------------------------
show parameter spfile : to show full path of spfile.

oracle_sid=xyz 
-------------
//these are the file that oracle check before starting mean initializing file.if any one of them exist then it loads oracale.else not 
/////////////
spfilexyz.ora
spfile.ora
initxyz.ora
/////////////

Alter Log(*.lof + trace files(*.trc)):
-------------------------------------
alter log files tell us about major events on database when we startup and shutdown etc.
trace file that use on session level.
these files are in dump directory.

show parameter background_dump_dest : to show the path of dump directory

control file(*.ctl):
-------------------
these file tell about the database file structure.where are different file exist in our system.

select name from v$controlfile : to show path of cotrol file.


Backup File:
-----------
to backup db.



Logic Storage Structure:
========================
the largest logical structure is "system tablespace" every single database space reisdes inside "system tablespace"
there are two special table spaces.1) system tablespace. 2) sysaux tablespace. that are going to exist on every single database.
"system tablespace" : it is use for data dictionary or meta data.its store the whole information about your database.
"sysaux tablespace" : that is use for auxilary purpose.(in 9i these two are combine)
we arent suppose to use these tables b/c these are reserved for speciall purpose.
typical you have user table space.for every user their is its own table space.
"undo tablespace" that is use to store the default image information about your data in case to use rollback then its there.
"temp tablespace" is use to sort the data in case of not have enoughe memory space.sorting is very expensive operation.
every single object in database will be conatin inside the tablespace and only inside of one tablespace unless you are performing
partitioning that can go in different partion for different table.
"segment" is the next smallest logical unit.
if the space of segment table fills up then oracle allocate another area called "extent table".that is not directly attached to
previous segment. they are in different memory fregment but are linked.
"database block" is the smallest logical unit,its not exactly mapped to operating sytem logical block it can be of multiple of the os blocks.

PGA(program global area)
PMON(process monitor)
SMON(Server monitor)

if redo log file filled up then it use "ARCH log".
"SHARED POOL" : cache the commands(hashed commands)
