After installation of Oracle10g, there was a problem ..couldnt login using SQL+. None of the accounts(scott/tiger) worked . At last a quick web search gave the solution . Here is what it is:

From your command prompt, type
sqlplus "/ as sysdba"

Once logged in as SYSDBA, you need to unlock the SCOTT account
SQL> alter user scott account unlock;
SQL> grant connect, resource to scott;
