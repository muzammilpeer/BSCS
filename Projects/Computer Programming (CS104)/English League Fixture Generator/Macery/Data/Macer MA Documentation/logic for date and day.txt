1)generate 2 number mod by 5// FOR number of matches in week in different days.
2)get current date
3)geneate 1 number mod by 5// for low priroty of week day select the day.
4)now combine the date and day like this(current date+day)for first week day match.
e.g:20 may 2008,tuesday ==number of matches are geneated by 1st step 3 number choose one of them for this day match.
and then add 2nd random number in date that is geneated in 1st step
oh no
sorry
you subtract
in real
like this 20+6 for sat match
and +1 for sunday match
now you have one week match schedule
for next weeks you just update the date by making date static
and adding first rand() geneated number in 1st step
thats all
but here is a logic
for first rand() number generated in 1st step that is we compare all these 3 number and check which is smaller than all then we choose it for 1st rand() number.
b/c in real case we see that some matches are specials
so the oneday have less match will be that
